				<p>Parkour is a training discipline using movement with aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment and in the fastest, safest and most efficient way possible.</p>
				<p>Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, rolling, quadrupedal movement, and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation.</p>
				
				<p>Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.</p>
				<p>Parkour was developed in France, primarily by Raymond Belle, and further by his son David Belle and his group of friends, the self-styled Yamakasi, during the late 1980s. The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, and advertisements featuring the Yamakasi <cite>(by Luck Besson).</cite></p>
				<p>It is important to recognize that David Belle, though central to its ongoing development, was only one among a larger group of individuals who nurtured the art of movement into being, including Sebastian Foucan, Stephane Vigroux, Yahn Hnautra, David Malgogne, Chau Belle-Dinh and Frederic Hnautra among others, all of whom contributed to the art in its embryonic stage.</p>
				<h3>Ethymology</h3>
				<p>A practitioner of parkour is called a <em>traceur</em>, with the feminine form being <em>traceuse</em> - "to trace", as in "tracing a path". The term traceur was originally the name of a parkour group headed by David Belle which included Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.</p>
				<h3>Philosophy</h3>
				<p>David Belle says he trains people because he wants it <q>to be alive</q> and <q>for people to use it</q>.</p>
				<p>Châu Belle explains it is a "type of freedom" or "kind of expression"; that parkour is "only a state of mind" rather than a set of actions, and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers.</p>
				<p>David Belle stressed that <q>the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. Precision is all about being measured.</q>
				</p>
			<blockquote><em>David: "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else."</em></blockquote>
			<p>David also quotes his father Raymond: <q>If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one</q>.</p>
			<p>Although parkour is not an extreme sport, it does carry inherent risk with it just as any athletic training discipline does.However, excessive risk-taking runs in opposition to the philosophy of parkour. According to one participant, <em>“one of the most striking differences between parkour and other so-called ‘extreme’ sports is that it is not concerned solely with the acquisition of physical skills, but also with the improvement of one’s mental and spiritual well-being. Ensuring that physical progress is not at the expense of mental progress is one of the main aims of a good traceur”</em>.</p>
			<h3>Practice</h3>
			<p>The experienced traceurs do not engage in the activity in order to experience the adrenaline-rush that comes from excessive risk-taking. Rather, <em>they view their practise as challenging themselves to overcome limitation and the restraints of fear and inhibition.</em> The goal of complete functionality within any situation is paramount, and in order ot achieve this state both mentally and physically it is necessary to face and overcome the challenges that are part and parcel of parkour training. The training in parkour enables the practitioner to learn to manage risk and through exposure to challengin situations to become a better, safer person all round.</p>
			<h3>Derivative terminologies and disciplines</h3>
			<p>In September 2003, the documentary Jump London, starring Sébastien Foucan, was released. In the documentary, the term "freerunning" was used as an attempt to translate "parkour", in order to make it more appealing to the English-speaking audience. Foucan decided to keep using the term "freerunning" to describe his discipline, to distinguish it from David Belle's methods.</p>
			<p>The remaining seven Yamakasi members continued to use the term <strong>"l'art du déplacement"</strong>, also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour. Similar to Sébastien's freerunning, l'art du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original Yamakasi group, more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible. David Belle kept the term <strong>"parkour"</strong>, saying the group contributed to the development of it, but that his father was the source of his motivation, who had verbally communicated this method only to him.</p>
			<p>Both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and self-expression; <em>in freerunning, the greater emphasis is on self-expression, like flips and tricks</em>. Although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern, practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners.</p>
